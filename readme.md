# 100 Days of Learning 

## About
Log of learning from enrolled online courses. This serves as a personal tracker to check progress in learning enrolled courses. I have recieved a sponsor from Department of Science and Technology for Certification so I need a place to organize my notes and organize my progress as well. 

I also have started a few days prior so most logs starting from Day 1 are no longer from beginning but still in Week 1. 

## Courses: 
- Data Science - John Hopkins University
- Machine Learning (Standord University)
- Improve Your English Communication Skills 
    - Write Professional Emails in English
